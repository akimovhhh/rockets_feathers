    "Using monthly data, I do **not** find robust evidence of **asymmetric retail adjustment** to wholesale shocks (i.e., no clear “rockets and feathers” pattern) in the specifications explored above. Point estimates sometimes differ across positive vs. negative wholesale changes, but these differences are **not stable across horizons/specifications** and are difficult to distinguish from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This null result has two interpretations:\n",
    "1. **True symmetry:** retail egg prices may adjust roughly symmetrically to wholesale movements in this period.\n",
    "2. **Data and frequency limitations:** with a relatively short monthly sample and aggregation from weekly wholesale reports, the analysis may be underpowered to detect asymmetry that operates at higher frequency (e.g., within-week pricing, promotions, or category management).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next step.** Replicate the same design using **weekly retail scanner data (Nielsen)** (and potentially regional variation) to increase statistical power and to better align the timing of retail and wholesale movements. If asymmetry exists primarily in adjustment speed rather than long-run pass-through, weekly data should make it substantially easier to detect.\n"
